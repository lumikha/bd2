A part of the land between Ayala Avenue, Makati Avenue and Paseo de Roxas and of course the buildings on those streets make up what is now referred to as the Ayala Triangle, a sub-disctrict of the Makati main business community in the Philippines. Abounding within and around the triangle are high rise buildings of multinational companies, banks and many other major names in the Philippines’ business circle. In addition, it is neat to recall that Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas once held the runways of then Nielson Field, Metro Manila’s pre-World War II main airport in the 1930s.

Buildings within the Triangle include the former Makati Stock Exchange Centre and Ayala Tower One (housing the Philippine Stock Exchange) which are along the Ayala Avenue and also the old Nielson Tower along Makati Avenue which was converted into a library. The Triangle was also furnished with many public art installations by renowned artists of the Philippines, Ovvian Castillo-Hill and Ral Arrogante.

At the last quarter of 2010, a commercial area opened right in the middle of the Triangle. Instantly became a trend in Makati, the line of al fresco restaurants, bakeries and cafes behind the Makati Stock Exchange building are collectively known as the Ayala Triangle Gardens. With the fast-paced life of premier Makati, the Gardens has become an urban oasis, an avenue to relax, jog, hang-out or even just appreciate the greens amidst the hustle and bustle of urban city living. The over 20,000 square meters landscape sprouted over a hundred of trees that complete the calming ambience of the perimeter of this side of the Philippines.

Aside from the strip of bistros throughout the Ayala Triangle Gardens, there are also classic attractons within the area. These include the Filipinas Heritage Library which functions as a cyber research center on the history of the Philippines along with Philippine art, language, religion, among others. The area is also home to monuments memoralizing national heroes of the Philippines, namely: Gabriela Silang, Ninoy Aquino and Sultan Kudarat. — Brian Dudley, Makati City, Manila, Philippines
